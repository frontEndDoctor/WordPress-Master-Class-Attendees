This means that you don‚Äôt have to pay a license or you don‚Äôt have to pay to use it.\\n\\nEasy to use: WordPress is easy to use. Not only it‚Äôs simple to install and to conÔ¨Ågure, you also don‚Äôt need any technical knowledge to create and to maintain the content. \\n\\nFlexible: Because WordPress is a Ô¨Çexible platform, it‚Äôs easy to suit your needs. The default conÔ¨Åguration contains the basics, but you also can extend WordPress with a lot of interesting and powerful plugins. \\n\\nUsed worldwide: WordPress is used worldwide; thousands of blogs and websites run on the WordPress platform. Depending on the source, it‚Äôs reported that 8 to 12% of the websites worldwide are running on WordPress!! \\n\\nConstantly in development: A lot of developers work together to constantly make WordPress better.\\n4/7/20, 20:28 - Blessed: How strong will a website that\\'s built with WordPress be?\\n4/7/20, 20:28 - Josh: As strong as any other website in the world\\n4/7/20, 20:31 - +234 903 807 0712: Ok\\n4/7/20, 20:32 - Josh: *WordPress.com* vs *WordPress.org* \\n\\nIf you\\'re thinking about starting a WordPress blog, you probably noticed there are 2 versions of WordPress:  WordPress.com and WordPress.org.\\n\\nSo which one should you choose? That depends on your requirements. Let‚Äôs take a closer look! WordPress.com.\\n4/7/20, 20:33 - Josh: WordPress.com is a better option when you don\\'t want to host your blog yourself. Remember what we talked about hosting yesterday.

That is it will have its land, certificate of ownership and can do as it pleases. But a site without host can not do as they like because of the policies guiding it.\\n4/7/20, 20:52 - Uchechi EE: Sorry sir why are they saying dat d site z nt secure for inputing my personal details like password etc\\n4/7/20, 20:53 - Josh: Is because WordPress are Blogspot offers the same platform for bloggers\\n4/7/20, 20:54 - Josh: What site did you click on?\\n4/7/20, 20:54 - Uchechi EE: The second site\\n4/7/20, 20:54 - Uchechi EE: Ok i saw only blog\\n4/7/20, 20:56 - Josh: This is because the site is not secured, that\\'s having *SSL* we will understand this when we ride to that place.\\n4/7/20, 20:57 - Josh: @2348136854100 hope you now get this?\\n4/7/20, 20:57 - Uchechi EE: Ok sir tnx\\n4/7/20, 20:57 - Josh: ü§ù\\n4/7/20, 20:57 - Blessed: Yes sir\\n4/7/20, 20:57 - Josh: I believe we can ride on\\n4/7/20, 20:58 - Blessed: One more question please\\n4/7/20, 20:58 - Josh: Ok\\n4/7/20, 20:59 - Blessed: Does it mean that when we host a site using WordPress, the domain name can stand alone?\\n4/7/20, 21:00 - Josh: Yes\\n4/7/20, 21:00 - Blessed: Ok\\n4/7/20, 21:00 - Josh: It\\'s the hosting that takes away the .WordPress.com attached to the site original name\\n4/7/20, 21:01 - Blessed: Thanks for the clarification\\n4/7/20, 21:01 - Josh: üëÜ\\n4/7/20, 21:01 - Blessed: Yea\\n4/7/20, 21:01 - Josh: ü§ù\\n4/7/20, 21:01 - Uchechi EE: Sorry does it means dat wordpress serves as a name server?\\n4/7/20, 21:03 - Josh: No, but it draws information from the original WordPress server\\n4/7/20, 21:04 - Uchechi EE: Pls explain more sir\\n4/7/20, 21:08 - Josh: <Media omitted>\\n4/7/20, 21:11 - Uchechi EE: So in essence the second site has wordpress as d host ryt\\n4/7/20, 21:14 - Josh: Yes\\n4/7/20, 21:14 - Uchechi EE: Ok sir\\n4/7/20, 21:14 - Josh: When we move further into this u will understand better\\n4/7/20, 21:15 - Blessed: Thanks\\n4/7/20, 21:15 - Josh: Kindly write out the things that looks confusing so that when it\\'s been treated as a topic you can easily refer back to your note for better understanding.\\n\\n *Notepad is Important*\\n4/7/20, 21:17 - Josh: Let\\'s continue\\n4/7/20, 21:18 - Josh: A WordPress.com site is hard to customize (limited choice of themes and functionalities) and you can\\'t include your own ads. This will make it a poor option if you\\'re planning to make money with your blog. A last thing you have to keep in mind is that you don\\'t own the blog, but WordPress does. \\n\\nThey can end your blog at any time if your blog doesn\\'t meet there policy.\\n4/7/20, 21:19 - Blessed: Wow!\\n4/7/20, 21:19 - Uchechi EE: Dat means wordpress.Com z nt d best option for blogging\\n4/7/20, 21:20 - Josh: Nop\\n4/7/20, 21:20 - Blessed: ‚ùî‚ùî\\n4/7/20, 21:20 - Josh: But there\\'s another option\\n4/7/20, 21:21 - Uchechi EE: For me any site dat can easily access ur privacy is nt d best\\n4/7/20, 21:21 - Uchechi EE: Ok sir\\n4/7/20, 21:22 - Josh: Let\\'s talk about WordPress.org!\\n\\nWordPress.org is much more Ô¨Çexible, but it comes with a cost: you need a domain name and web hosting to host your blog. On the other hand, this isn\\'t a big cost.\\n4/7/20, 21:22 - Josh: Hosting fees start at a couple of dollars a month. Using this method gives you much more freedom: you can use the theme of your choice and extend your blog with a choice of plugins, adding a lot more functionality to your blog.\\n4/7/20, 21:27 - Josh: Now everyone visit\\nWordPress.com and wordpress.org\\n\\nTell me a difference you spotted in both\\n4/7/20, 21:28 - Uchechi EE: Wordpress.org enable d user to hv its privacy bt wordpress.Com doesnt\\n4/7/20, 21:29 - Josh: ‚úÖ\\n4/7/20, 21:29 - Josh: Anyone else\\n4/7/20, 21:31 - Uchechi EE: Wordpress.Org helps u to host ur blog bt wordpress.com doesnt\\n4/7/20, 21:32 - Josh: ‚úÖ\\n4/7/20, 21:32 - Blessed: I was about saying this\\n4/7/20, 21:32 - Josh: Lol\\n4/7/20, 21:33 - Blessed: Seems like WordPress has more templates\\n4/7/20, 21:33 - Josh: There are several things, think out of the box\\n4/7/20, 21:33 - Josh: ‚úÖ\\n4/7/20, 21:35 - Uchechi EE: You can easily add functionality to ur blog wit d use of wordpress.org bt wordpress.com cnt\\n4/7/20, 21:39 - Josh: @2347066524469 you have read my message do give me a reply\\n4/7/20, 21:41 - Josh: <Media omitted>\\n4/7/20, 21:42 - Roberto: Okay sir\\n4/7/20, 21:42 - Roberto: Sorry I was having ba3 issues\\n4/7/20, 21:43 - Roberto: Just came online and was going through earlier messages\\n4/7/20, 21:44 - Josh: Ok you welcome\\n4/7/20, 21:44 - Roberto: Thanks sir\\n4/7/20, 21:46 - Josh: Ok let me save our time.....\\n\\nThe difference is that they have deferent designs despite designed by the same company. üòÅ\\n4/7/20, 21:46 - Josh: Let\\'s move on\\n4/7/20, 21:47 - Blessed: That\\'s really the most striking thing\\n4/7/20, 21:47 - Josh: If you\\'re planning to create a company blog or site, then you should go for this option.

A domain name is your website‚Äôs address on the internet. This is what your users will type in their browsers to reach your site (For example, 300empire.com.ng or google.com).\\n4/7/20, 21:51 - Josh: Are we together?\\n4/7/20, 21:53 - Blessed: By arranging it ourselves, what do you mean?\\n4/7/20, 21:54 - Roberto: Yes sir\\n4/7/20, 21:54 - Josh: Buy\\n4/7/20, 21:54 - Josh: üòÅ\\n4/7/20, 21:54 - Blessed: How much are we looking at?\\n4/7/20, 21:55 - Josh: We are going there now\\n4/7/20, 21:55 - Josh: We still have 5min\\n4/7/20, 21:56 - Josh: Next, you‚Äôll need website hosting. All websites on the internet need hosting.\\n\\nThis will be your website‚Äôs home on the internet.\\n\\nA domain name typically costs $14.99 (#5,396)/year and hosting costs start from $7.99(#2,876)/month = $95.88(#34,516)/year.\\n\\n With this illustration we can see that the total cost of buying a domain and hosting a site for the first time is $110.87(#39,912).\\n4/7/20, 21:57 - Josh: This is A LOT for most people who are just starting out. And most of the times clients can‚Äôt pay this much as they have maybe not earned so much to be able to finance such budget, so what do we do?\\n4/7/20, 21:57 - Blessed: Good question\\n4/7/20, 21:58 - Josh: Remember workmanship never dey inside am o üò•üò•üò•\\n4/7/20, 21:59 - Roberto: Na wa oh\\n4/7/20, 21:59 - Roberto: N then looking at our population again\\n4/7/20, 22:01 - Josh: ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£\\n\\nYou don dey fear\\n4/7/20, 22:01 - Josh: Do u have an answer?\\n4/7/20, 22:02 - Blessed: I don\\'t ooo.\\nüö∂üèø\\u200d‚ôÇüö∂üèø\\u200d‚ôÇüö∂üèø\\u200d‚ôÇ\\n4/7/20, 22:07 - Josh: Don\\'t mind me\\n4/7/20, 22:08 - Josh: We look for a hosting site that can offer the same service at a cheaper rate and the same quality.

Instead, you can type in an easy to remember domain name, for example, Google.com\\n4/8/20, 20:35 - Josh: *What is Web Hosting?*\\nWeb hosting is the place where all the files of your website lives. It is like the home of your website where it actually lives.\\n\\nA good way to think about this is if the domain name was the address of your house, then web hosting is the actual house that address points to. All websites on the internet, need web hosting.\\n4/8/20, 20:36 - Josh: When someone enters your domain name in a browser, the domain name is translated into the IP address of your web hosting company‚Äôs computer. This computer contains your website‚Äôs files, and it sends those files back to the users‚Äô browsers.\\n\\nWeb hosting companies specialize in storing and serving websites. They offer different types of hosting plans to their customers.\\n4/8/20, 20:36 - Josh: Hope we are following?\\n4/8/20, 20:40 - Josh: Are we sleeping?\\n4/8/20, 20:41 - Uchechi EE: No sir though d weather z cold\\n4/8/20, 20:43 - Josh: Ok\\n4/8/20, 20:44 - Josh: How Domain Names and Web Hosting are Related?\\nDomain names and web hosting are two different services. However, they work together to make websites possible.\\n4/8/20, 20:44 - Josh: Basically a domain name system is like a massive address book that is constantly updated. Behind each domain name, there is an address of the web hosting service storing the website‚Äôs files.\\n\\nWithout domain names, it will not be possible for people to find your website and without web hosting you cannot build a website.\\n4/8/20, 20:48 - Josh: Buying a domain name alone only gives you right to use that particular domain name for a specific period (usually 1 year).\\n\\nYou need web hosting to store your website‚Äôs files. After you get hosting, you need to update your domain name settings and point it to your web hosting service provider.\\n4/8/20, 20:49 - Josh: Do I have to buy them together? Or can I buy them separately?\\n\\nYou can buy domain name and web hosting from two different companies. However, in that case you will have to point your domain name to your web hosting company by editing its DNS settings.\\n4/8/20, 20:49 - Josh: On the other hand, if you purchase your domain name and web hosting from the same company, then you will not have to change domain name settings.\\n\\nIt is also much easier to manage and renew both services under the same dashboard.\\n\\nIf you want to buy domain names separately, then you can do so from top providers like: Godaddy and NameCheap.\\n4/8/20, 20:51 - Uchechi EE: Does it mean we hv to renew our domain name every year\\n4/8/20, 20:55 - Josh: Now every domain name and hosting has a minimum registration duration of one year, but if you want to go beyond that you can pay the extra year as much as you want\\n4/8/20, 20:55 - Josh: So yes\\n4/8/20, 20:55 - Uchechi EE: Ok sir\\n4/8/20, 20:57 - Josh: Now we are going to be looking at Hostnownow.com. I prefer using this company because they are Nigerian based and they are also of quick response.\\n4/8/20, 20:58 - Josh: The fact that you\\'re a web designer doesn\\'t mean you should automatically know everything, there are times when your clients will tell you to do the impossible now this host companies helps you in achieving what they want you to do by giving you some advise or helping you do it themselves.\\n4/8/20, 20:58 - Josh: That\\'s why I use them\\n4/8/20, 21:00 - Josh: Other web designers prefer the hosts like GoDaddy, NameCheap, whogohost, and they have their reasons also.\\n4/8/20, 21:02 - Uchechi EE: <Media omitted>\\n4/8/20, 21:03 - Josh: <Media omitted>\\n4/8/20, 21:05 - Josh: <Media omitted>\\n4/8/20, 21:06 - Uchechi EE: <Media omitted>\\n4/8/20, 21:06 - Uchechi EE: <Media omitted>\\n4/8/20, 21:08 - Uchechi EE: Tnk u sir\\n4/8/20, 21:09 - Josh: Now what you want me to enlighten you about is what we are treating right now, buying of domain and hosting.

Just as we already know that WordPress is a platform where you can start the creation of layout in a way the website is supposed to display.\\n4/9/20, 20:23 - Josh: There are several ways you can install the WordPress platform, but we are going to be looking at one. This one is the most popular way of installing the WordPress platform, it is easier and more comfortable.\\n4/9/20, 20:25 - Josh: We\\'re going to be looking at how to install the WordPress platform using the control panel, now the control panel is gotten after the domain and the hosting has been purchased. The control panel is issued out by the hosting service and with this control panel you can add several features you would like on your website even without the installing the WordPress platform.\\n4/9/20, 20:30 - Josh: With the control panel you can create for instance a custom email address. For example looking at the assignment given Richard consultants and management, after creating a website for this organisation an email address is needed, now instead of giving or creating an email address called Richardconsultants@gmail.com we create a custom email address for example service@richardconsultants.com or info@Richardconsultants.com\\n4/9/20, 20:33 - Josh: *How to install WordPress using the control panel?*\\n4/9/20, 20:37 - Josh: Generally, Softaculous, QuickInstall, and Fantastico are the most popular options.\\n\\nBut I will show you how to install WordPress using Softaculous. You can follow the instructions, based on the installer you see on your cPanel dashboard.\\n\\nHow to Install WordPress using Softaculous\\nSoftaculous is a popular auto-installer script. It allows you to easily install popular web applications like WordPress with just a few clicks. \\n\\n.\\n4/9/20, 20:37 - Josh: Simply login to your cPanel account and look for Softaculous or WordPress installer icon. You will find them under Auto Installers section.\\n4/9/20, 20:38 - Josh: <Media omitted>\\n4/9/20, 20:38 - Josh: Clicking on any of these icons will launch Softaculous auto-installer for WordPress. First, you will see an overview of WordPress. You need to click on the Install tab to continue.\\n\\nClick on the install tab to continue installing WordPress using Softaculous\\n4/9/20, 20:38 - Josh: <Media omitted>\\n4/9/20, 21:09 - Josh: Softaculous will now ask you where you want to install WordPress. You need to choose http:// or http://www. as protocol.\\n\\nIf your site has SSL and HTTPS, then you can select https:// or https://www. as protocol.\\n\\nAfter that, you need to choose the domain name where you want to install WordPress. Most users want to install WordPress in their domain‚Äôs root directory, like example.com. In that case, you need to make sure that the ‚ÄòIn Directory‚Äô field is blank.\\n4/9/20, 21:11 - Josh: <Media omitted>\\n4/9/20, 21:11 - Josh: Scroll down a little, and you will see the site settings section.\\n\\nSoftaculous WordPress site settings\\n\\nUnder this section, first you need to provide a title and description for your WordPress site. Don‚Äôt worry you can easily change them from your WordPress admin area after installation.\\n4/9/20, 21:12 - Josh: Next, you need to choose an admin username, password, and email address. Softaculous will automatically fill in the username and password fields for you. It will use a non-dictionary word for username and a strong password.\\n\\nYou can change them if you want so that they are easy to remember for you. However, we strongly urge you to always use a strong password. See our guide on the best way to manage passwords for WordPress beginners to learn how you can manage strong passwords easily.\\n4/9/20, 21:12 - Josh: <Media omitted>\\n4/9/20, 21:13 - Josh: <Media omitted>\\n4/9/20, 21:13 - Josh: Make sure that you enter correct email address in the admin email field. This is where WordPress will send notifications and password reset link if you ever forgot your password.\\n\\nRest of the options on the screen are optional. You can now click on the install button to run the installer.\\n4/9/20, 21:14 - Josh: <Media omitted>\\n4/9/20, 21:14 - Josh: Softaculous will run the installer using the settings you provided. You will see a progress bar with installation status. It will take a couple of minutes. Do not close the window until the progress bar reaches 100% otherwise, this may affect your WordPress installation.\\n4/9/20, 21:15 - Josh: <Media omitted>\\n4/9/20, 21:15 - Josh: You will see a success message after the installation is finished. It will also show you links to your website and to your WordPress admin area.\\n\\nSoftaculous WordPress installation finished\\n4/9/20, 21:15 - Josh: <Media omitted>\\n4/9/20, 21:24 - Josh: That\\'s all for now\\n4/9/20, 21:24 - Josh: We continue tomorrow\\n4/9/20, 21:25 - Uchechi EE: Netwrk have really dealt wit me today oo\\n4/9/20, 21:26 - Uchechi EE: Tnx sir we wil try all u said\\n4/10/20, 19:24 - Josh: Today\\'s class starts by 8pm.
